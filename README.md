# Sabermetrics Project

This project introduced two new stats, %TBA and REC as explained in the 'Project Proposal.pdf' file. 

In order to build this project, navigate to /Code directory and use the command 'python UI.py'. This will launch a window with different options to see the top X players for each stat and a variety of graphs. 

You can also inspect the 'AdvancedBaseStats.csv' in the /Code directory if you would like to mess around with the data yourself.

Only data from the 2010-2013 MLB seasons are included, however you could take data from whatever year you want and run it as long as the format is the same as the 'BaseStats.csv' file.
